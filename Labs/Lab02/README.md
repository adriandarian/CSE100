# Merge Sort

## Description

In this lab assignment your job is to implement Merge-Sort. See the text book for the algorithm and it's pseudo-code. You must output the given elements (integers) in non-decreasing order.

## Input Structure

The input starts with an integer number which indicates the number of elements, `n`. Then, the elements follow, one per line.

## Output Structure

Output the elements in non-decreasing order. Each element must be fol-lowed by ;.

## Examples of Input and Output

6
4
```

#### _Output_

`1;2;3;4;5;6;`

> Note that the output has only one line and has no white characters.
