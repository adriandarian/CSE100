# Quick Sort

## Description

> This is the second half of Lab04 and is worth 50 points. In this lab assignment (Lab04-2), your job is to implement the randomized version of Quick-sort. That is, you must choose a random pivot from the elements in $A[p...r]$ when partitioning the subarray. For more details, see page 179 of the textbook. The following webpage describes a simple way to obtain a random integer: `http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/`

## Input Structure

> The input starts with an integer number which indicates the number of elements (integers) to be sorted, $n$. Then, the elements follow, one per line.

## Output Structure

> Output the elements in non-decreasing order. Each element must be followed by ;.

## Examples of input and output:

### Input

```
6
5
3
2
1
6
4
```

### Output

`1;2;3;4;5;6;`

> Note that the output has only one line and has no white characters.

See the lab guidelines for submission/grading, etc., which can be found in Files/Labs.
