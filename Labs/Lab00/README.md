## Description

> This lab is intended to help you understand how you should test and submit your own code. Therefore, we provide a solution (yourid.cpp) and this lab will NOT be graded.

## Input Structure

> The input starts with an integer number which indicates the number of elements (integers) in the input sequence, n. Then, the elements in the sequence follow, one per line.

## Output Structure

> Output the maximum of all numbers in the sequence, followed by a semicolon and the minimum number. The should be no white character in your output.
