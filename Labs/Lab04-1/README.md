# Heap Sort

## Description

> In this lab assignment (lab 04-1), your job is to implement heap-sort. This is the first half of lab 04 and is worth 50 points.

## Input Structure

> The input starts with an integer number which indicates the number of elements (integers) to be sorted, $n$. Then, the elements follow, one per line.

## Output Structure

> Output the elements in non-decreasing order. Each element must be followed by ;.

## Examples of input and output

### Input

```c++
6
5
3
2
1
6
4
```

### Output

`1;2;3;4;5;6;`

> Note that the output has only one line and has no white characters.

See the lab guidelines for submission/grading, etc., which can be found in Files/Labs.
